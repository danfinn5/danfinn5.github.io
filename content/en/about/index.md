## Personal Summary
I am a Technical Writer and Documentation Systems Architect with extensive experience designing scalable, AI-integrated documentation platforms aligned with modern DevOps and developer experience practices. I have a proven ability to lead cross-functional teams, define documentation strategy, and deliver clear, high-impact content across user, API, and release documentation. I combine hands-on writing expertise with ownership of docs-as-code infrastructure, CI/CD content pipelines, and LLM-based automation. I am also known for bridging engineering and operations through strategic tooling, platform governance, and thoughtful content architecture—enabling fast-moving teams to ship, scale, and support with clarity.
