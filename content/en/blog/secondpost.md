  I moved the site to Hugo on Netlify for quicker updates and easy previews.

I gave the portfolio a small rebuild. It still uses **Hugo**, but it now deploys on **Netlify**.

## What changed
- **Faster updates.** Each publish is a full snapshot of the site—no half-updated pages—and I can roll back in seconds.
- **Preview links.** Every branch gets its own preview URL, so I can check changes before they go live.
- **Cleaner source.** Public portfolio assets live in a separate GitHub repo to keep things tidy.
- **API docs demo.** I added an interactive API Guide with a “try it” experience.

## Why this helps
- I can ship small improvements more often.
- Reviews are easier because you can see exactly what will go live.
- If something breaks, I can restore the previous version immediately.

More updates coming as I add scripts, automation write-ups, and a few additional API examples. If you spot anything off, ping me through the contact form.
