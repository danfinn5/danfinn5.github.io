## Getting Started with the Classic European Cars API

Welcome to the Classic European Cars API! This API allows you to retrieve and manage data about classic European cars and collections. Whether you want to build an app that showcases classic cars or manage your own collection, this guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have:
- A basic understanding of RESTful APIs and OAuth2.
- An API client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) installed.
- OAuth2 credentials (client ID and client secret) to access the API.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with the Classic European Cars API quickly:

### Step 1: Obtain OAuth2 Credentials

First, ensure you have your OAuth2 credentials (client ID and client secret).

### Step 2: Authenticate

Follow the authentication steps provided in this guide to authenticate your API client.

### Step 3: Make Your First Request

Once authenticated, use the `/cars` endpoint to retrieve a list of classic European cars.

## Authentication

This API uses **OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow** for secure access. You will need to obtain an authorization code to interact with the API. Follow these steps:

1. **Obtain Authorization URL**  
   Direct the user to the following URL to log in and grant access to their account:

   ```plaintext
   http://example.com/oauth/auth
   ```

2. **Receive Authorization Code**  
   After a successful login, the user will be redirected to your redirect URI with an authorization code.

3. **Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token**  
   Make a `POST` request to the token URL to exchange the authorization code for an access token:

   ```plaintext
   POST http://example.com/oauth/token
   ```

   Request Parameters:
   - `client_id`: Your client ID
   - `client_secret`: Your client secret
   - `code`: The authorization code you received
   - `grant_type`: "authorization_code"

Once you have the access token, include it in the `Authorization` header in each API request.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```plaintext
https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/DANFINN5/EuroClassics/1.0.0
```
