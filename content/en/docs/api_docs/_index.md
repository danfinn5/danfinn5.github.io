description: "Sample documentation set for a REST API"
---
Welcome to the API documentation section of my site. This provides a sample set of REST API documentation for an API spec Iâ€™ve created and hosted on Swaggerhub. The documentation covers everything you need to get started, including an overview, authentication, a quick start guide, and an interactive Swagger-based reference.

Since the API spec is hosted on Swaggerhub, you can even interact with the documentation and make API calls to retrieve sample data.

## The Classic European Cars API

This API allows you to retrieve and manage data about classic European cars, such as their make, model, and year. Ideal for collectors and enthusiasts who want to build apps, or maintain personal car collections.

### Key Features:
- Retrieve a list of classic European cars
- Add cars to a collection
- Contribute new data on rare models
- OAuth2 authentication for secure access
