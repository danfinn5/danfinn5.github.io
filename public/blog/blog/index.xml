      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to introduce you to my personal portfolio website! As a technical writer with a passion for creating clear and concise documentation, this site serves as a showcase of my professional journey, skills, and accomplishments.&#xA;Built with Hugo and Hosted on GitHub Pages&#xD;I chose Hugo as the static site generator (SSG) for its speed, flexibility, and ease of use. Hugo allows me to quickly build and deploy a fast, secure, and reliable website without the need for a complex content management system.</description>
